# Dog Master

## ü§î What is this game about?
This game is about a dog who is craving for some snacks.
Move his bowl using the buttons to catch treats for him. Try to make the highest score as possible but watch your lives!
Be quick! This game gets faster as it goes!

## ‚ùì Rules
- There are 3 types of snacks you can catch:
    1) **Yummy snacks** - **bone**, **ham**, **sausage** - these will get you 10 points each
    2) **Chocolate** - beware, this will cost you 1 life as the chocolate is poisonous for dogs
    3) **Bonuses** - **extra life** (pretty self-explanatory) or **2x multiplier** (active for 10 seconds)
- Don't let his snacks touch the floor
    - Except the **chocolate**, you can miss that one for your own good
    - You can also drop bonuses, but that's no good for you
- Don't let **anything** fall on his head, it hurts! It costs you 1 life also
- The game gets faster every 30 seconds of gameplay
